This gist is a recreation of the content found at https://developer.atlassian.com/blog/2016/02/best-way-to-store-dotfiles-git-bare-repo/.
I could not get the refrenced snippets to work, so I recreated what I imagine they might have contained.

__note:__ I have not tested these scripts. As things stand they are not to be executed, I created them purely for the purpose of allowing me to recall the presented process.
