#dotfiles-vcs
This repo contains scripts for setting up and maintaing dotfiles using git.
The content is a recreation of what can be found at https://developer.atlassian.com/blog/2016/02/best-way-to-store-dotfiles-git-bare-repo/.
I could not get the refrenced snippets to work, so I recreated what I imagine they might have contained.
